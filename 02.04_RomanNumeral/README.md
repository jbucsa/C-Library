# Roman Numberal 

## Description 


This program converts whole integer numbers inputs into Roman numerals outputs of equal value. The program only works for integers from 1 to 4000.


1. If you notice, as numbers increase in Roman numerals, the symbol for that represents the highest position of the number goes to the left. As one moves to the right, the symbols represent the lower values of a integer. This makes a left to right series, where highest values begins the integer, and lowest ends the integer.
   
2. A modulo can be used to find the reminders conversion need to find the single digit values in the Roman numeral.
   
3. The Romans did not believe in zero. So without having a zero value, one cannot create a value less than one because there is no position to place a zero value in the Roman numeral system.
   
4.  To do this, I got 4 branches with three parts cascaded within each branch except for the branch that is used for the one value.
   
5.  One of the loops is used to do the actual number conversion, another is for a value that is enter is greater than 4000, and another one for enter the value of zero.
   
6.   I would say at minimum, 3 test are needed. One to check what happens when a number great than 4000 is input. Another for enter zero. Lastly, another test for a number that would test if the program can solve for complex number, i.e. 3999 would work.

7. Roman numeral are still used every around the world. Plus, Latin is still used today because of the importance the Roman empire was to the creation of civilization. For that fact, it'll always be important to know.
   
8.  This can be done by just making a loop were both the "y" and "yes" are options for cin that give the same cout, i.e.: ``` \f1\fs20 \CocoaLigature0 ``` ``` if (strcmp(status, "yes")!=0 && strcmp(status, "y")!=0) ```
``` \f0\fs24 \CocoaLigature1 ```

9. Using the cstd library, and writing myUpper and/or myLower after the "yes" or "y" statement will allow for the lower and upper case "y" to be input.

10.   This just be done by inserting cout that read before and after the answer is given.
   
This program is written in C++.
