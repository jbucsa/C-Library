# Simple Resistance
    
This programs follows an users to calculate the total resistance of two resistors circuit. The output provides the solution for both cases of the resistors being either parallel and serie with one another

## Creater Comments
    
1 . There is only need for cin to be coded once in this program. It can be used twice, but a simpler way allows it to be used only once.
   
2 . It does not matter the order in which the resistances are put into the program. This is because there is no subtraction going on in the program when calculating the total resistance.
   
3 . ting up the program. Having them separated makes the program appear more clear.
   
4 . This program works fine if one separates their numbers by spaces or lines.
    
5 . I used a float to make sure that the parallel case worked and did not fail.
    
6 . I use 4 variables for num1, num2, total resistance for series, and parallel work well together. 
    
7 . Bare minimum, one needs 4 variables for each resistance. 
    
8 . 6 variables for each case, (2 for series, 2 for parallel, plus 2 totals) seem pointless.
    
9 . I did not allow fractions to be entered for R1 and R2, only integers. Also, values with exponentials do not work for R1 and R2. I set R_series to only work with integers and not fractions of numbers.
   
10 . I did not set the resistance to doubles, so an error message will come up. 
    
11 . A zero value will still work up fine. It just eliminates that resistance from the problems and leaves the other resistance to also equal the total resistance.
