# Point to Point 

## Description 

This program allows the user to input two separate pair of
coordinate points (x,y), in and the program outputs the distance and midpoint of
the two given pair of points.

1. There are a total of 6 variables needed. There are 3 coordinates used with 2 variables needed for each to work.


2. In this program it would be best to use whole numbers for the input, but this does not mean you cannot use fractions.


3. This programs finds mid point for both the x and y components, which values do not effect one another. The x and y values only effect one another when calculating the distance between the two points.


4. The program only gives a value of zero if the components cancel another out. The location will not cause the program to fail. It can only change answers to negative, positive, and/or depending on the value given to the separate coordinates.


5. Basically you can test the solution by changing the coordinates to include situations where the solutions have negative answers, zero answer, and undefined answers. 


## Additional Details 

1. I used a double to allow a common to be used 

2. 4 variables will be needed, i.e. X1, Y1, X2, and Y2.
