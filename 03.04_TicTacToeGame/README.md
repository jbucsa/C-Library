# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description 

This program allows two users to play Tic Tac Toe with one another. This is done by allowing each user to take turns entering in a number between 1 and 9. These values corresponds to locations on the display of the Tic Tac Toe board and will mark as either a X or an O. Only one number can be entered at a time. Allowing the players to take turns in the game play.


1.  Using a 
``` \f1\i vector<vector<int> ```
``` \f0\i0 ``` vector, one could use to store both digits and X or O.

2. Using an 
``` \i if ```
``` \i0 loop ``` with 
``` \f1\i board[row][col] ```
``` \f2\i0 ``` and input of 
``` \f1\i cin >> row >> col ```
``` \f2\i0 ``` one can write a code where 2-D coordinates can be input that corresponds to a position on the board.

3. I used an 
``` f1\i int checkwin() ```
``` \f2\i0 ``` with 
``` \f1\i if ```
``` \f2\i0  ``` and 
``` \f1\i else if ```
``` \f2\i0 ``` loops with all the multiple positions that correspond to all the possible winning games for a either player with the given positions marked.


This program is written in C++.
